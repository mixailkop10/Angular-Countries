##Create a feature in your Angular app that manages countries.

Ideally, you should create a separate Angular module that will contain one component. The component will be responsible for displaying a list of countries with the following properties:

name: string;

flag: string;

capital: string;

region: string;



Each country should be displayed as a Bootstrap card component https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/. 



The image of the card should display the flag of the country, the title should display the name of the country and the description should display a combination of capital and region such as:

Capital: Athens
Region: Europe


The backend URL that you are going to use is: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/
